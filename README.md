Records statistics about your character to your own [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com) server.  This plugin

#### Features
- Per-skill experience and levels
- Bank, seed vault, and inventory value, plus the top items from each
- Player combat level, quest points, skulled status, name, and overhead prayer
- Player position (disabled by default)
